Updated statistics from [BC-CDC](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/case-counts-press-statements).

BC had a lot of new cases, but hospitalization and ICU admissions are still declining.  My suspicion is that this is because more people who are not critically sick are being tested after the 9 April change in testing criteria.  

Vancouver Island numbers are still dropping with only 30 active cases across the island.  I'm not plotting it yet,
but there are only 5 people on Vancouver Island currently in the hospital from COVID-19.

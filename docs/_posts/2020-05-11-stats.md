Vancouver Island is down to 8 active cases.  BC as a whole is also still dropping.  It will be interesting to see if the easing fo restrictions will change that.  While they haven't officially been eased, a lot of restaurants etc are having more take out etc, and there certainly are more people out and about than a couple of weeks ago. 

Updated statistics from [BC-CDC](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/case-counts-press-statements).

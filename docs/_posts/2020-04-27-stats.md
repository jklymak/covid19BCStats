Big jump over weekend in BC cases, but that was largely because of a couple of institutional outbreaks.  Vancouver Island continues its improving trend, though there was a new fatality.  

Updated statistics from [BC-CDC](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/case-counts-press-statements).

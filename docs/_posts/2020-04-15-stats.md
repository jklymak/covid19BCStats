Note that BCCDC has added a dashboard!  
Updated statistics from [BC-CDC](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/data).  Testing has also been (quietly) expanded on 9 April to be at the discretion of healthcare providers and for anyone with symptoms.  It seems likely that case numbers will go up, so the concern is really if ICU cases go up, which would mean more people are getting really sick.

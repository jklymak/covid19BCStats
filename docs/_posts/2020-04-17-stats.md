BC has new modelling projections released today, [available here](https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Update_Modelling-DIGITAL.pdf).  BC is seriously considering lifting some of the social distancing requirements by the end of the month.  This seems reasonable to me, given that ICU beds are currently at 45% of capacity across the province, and people have shown willingness to clamp down if things get out of hand again.  

Updated statistics from [BC-CDC](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/case-counts-press-statements).

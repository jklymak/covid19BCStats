Post-weekend statitics.

Note that I had confused some numbers in previous plots of "currently" hospitalized versus cummulative hospitalizations.  
Unfortunately, had to go back through press statements to get these statistics correct.  Good news is that
hospitalizations are on the decrease.

Really good news for Vancouver Island, where active cases are now down to 28 (from a high of 49).

Updated statistics from [BC-CDC](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/case-counts-press-statements).

# Statistics for BC COVID 19 outbreak and some plots.

Source: mostly http://covid-19.bccdc.ca plus press reports before 15 Mar.  

This is provided with no warranty, and was quickly cobbled together for my own interest.  If you need this data for something serious, please do due dilligence and look the data up yourself!  There is no warranty express or implied.  I am also not at *all* trained in epidemiology, so do not assume my interpretation of the data has any meaning or value.  

That said, any suggestions or corrections gratefully accepted.  Or pointers to better databases and analyses!
